# Kainos Code Connect Challenge Team 3: Combat Fake Information

This project was developed as part of the **Kainos Code Connect Challenge**, a team-based initiative designed to teach agile methodologies and promote collaborative software development. Over the course of four two-week sprints, our team worked to build a web application to address the spread of fake news. Each sprint included planning sessions, show-and-tell presentations, and retrospectives to reflect on our progress and improve our workflow. The result is a dynamic application that provides users with tools to fact-check claims, learn about misinformation, and engage through interactive quizzes.

## Problem Statement
